               Identify the exact class, method, and line where the issue originated.
               Explain the root cause in simple terms, considering dependencies, input parameters, or incorrect configurations.
               Suggest code fixes and best practices to prevent the issue in the future.
               Ensure accuracyâ€”do not introduce any assumptions, speculations, or AI hallucinations. Base the response strictly on the given stack trace.
